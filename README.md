# DeepGrail

This is a Jupyter notebook with associate auxiliary files for some deep learning experiments using TLGbank data to develop part-of-speech taggers and supertaggers for use with GrailLight.


### Dependencies

This notebook requires some package for producing distributional vector representations for words. By default, this will be `fastText`, but it should be relatively simple to use other vector formats such as word2vec (I am not aware of any GloVe dataset for French).
