# DeepGrail

This is a Jupyter notebook with associate auxiliary files for some deep learning experiments using TLGbank data to develop part-of-speech taggers and supertaggers for use with GrailLight.


### Dependencies

This notebook requires some package for producing distributional vector representations for words. This can be either `fastText` (using https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html) or `ELMo` (using https://github.com/HIT-SCIR/ELMoForManyLangs).
